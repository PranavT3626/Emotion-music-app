# Emotion-Based Music AI
![Emotion-Based Music AI](emotion-based-music-ai.png)

This project is an innovative application that recommends music based on the user's detected emotions. By analyzing facial expressions, the AI determines the user's current emotion and suggests music that matches their mood. If the AI detects happiness, it will recommend music that aligns with that emotion.
